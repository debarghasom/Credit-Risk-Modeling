# Credit-Risk-Modelling-in-Python 
Credit risk is the chance that a borrower cannot make their payments on time and default on their debt. It refers to the risk that a lender may not receive their interest due or the principal lent on time.

## Objective
This project aims to predict the probability of default on a given obligation, in this case, credit cards. This will allow the generation of strategies that minimize the risk of deterioration of the client's financial health.

## Approach
 1. Data preparation and Pre-processing
     - Checking missing values
     - Outliers removal
 2. Feature Engineering and Selection
     - features selection
     - Scaling the features
     - Balancing the data
 3. Model Development and Model Evaluation
     - Logistic regression
     - Random Forest
     - Xgboost
     - Hyperparameter tuning
     - Cross validation


## Machine learning algorithm
- Logistic regression
- Random Forest
- Xgboost Classifer
- Cross-validation

## Model Evaluation
- I have achieved the final model accuracy 81.5%

## Conclusion:
Thus, I built the credit risk model using Python. I have tried different machine-learning algorithms, i.e., Logistic regression, Random Forest, and Xgboost classifier. I have also done hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. The final accuracy of the model we achieved was 81.5%.
